# restlay

The library handles client data synchronization with a REST server.

The name "restlay" comes from the library "relay" because takes many
inspirations from this GraphQL library.

## Roadmap

* DOCUMENTATION!
* TESTS! we need heavy tests so we can test different scenario, and if
  everything works as expected.
* reloading / optimisticRendering (from cache) => this needs to be more thought,
  tested and polished.
* pagination.
