# restlay

This folder will eventually be the generic part of our connectData lib so we might reuse it for other projects.

I suggest such lib would be called "restlay" because most ideas are kinda inspired from "relay" but for rest

Eventually, we should bring in the connectData / data store, anything that is generic...
i'm not even sure if this should continue dep on redux on the long term
and if this should expose ways to "hook" to specific api calls.

## TODO tests

we need heavy tests so we can test different scenario, and if everything works as expected.
